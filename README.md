# ML-basic-projects-
Basic machine learning projects focused on breast cancer classification and house price prediction using Python and Scikit-learn.
This is a basic machine learning project built to understand and implement the complete ML workflow

Two problem statements covered:
Breast Cancer Classification (Classification)
Breast Cancer Dataset: Medical diagnostic dataset for tumor classification.

House Price Prediction (Regression)
House Price Dataset: Real estate dataset with numerical and categorical features.

The datasets are loaded directly into the notebook for model training.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

Logistic Regression / Random Forest (Cancer)
Linear Regression / Random Forest (House Price)

Breast Cancer Prediction achieved high classification accuracy using supervised learning models.
House Price Prediction showed better performance with Random Forest compared to Linear Regression.
